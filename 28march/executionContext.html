    variables and function that is not inside any function. a new execut
ion context is created for each function call.
the global execution context just like any other execution context , except that it gets created bt default. it is associated with global object. which means a window object.  -->
 
<!-- Execution stack(calling stack)=> stack with LIFO structure,which is used to store all the execution context created during the code execution.  -->
